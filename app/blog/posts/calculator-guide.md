# Calculator: More Than Just Basic Math

Pendr's Calculator goes beyond basic arithmetic to provide a comprehensive calculation tool for everyday use, scientific work, and unit conversions. Whether you're balancing your budget, solving complex equations, or converting between measurement systems, our Calculator has you covered.

## Key Features

### Multiple Calculation Modes

Our Calculator offers three distinct modes:

- **Standard Mode**: Perfect for everyday calculations with basic arithmetic operations
- **Scientific Mode**: Advanced functions for complex mathematical operations
- **Unit Conversion Mode**: Convert between different units of measurement

### Standard Mode Features

The Standard mode includes:

- Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Percentage calculations
- Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- History tracking with the ability to reuse previous calculations
- Keyboard support for quick input

### Scientific Mode Features

Switch to Scientific mode for:

- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan and their inverses)
- Logarithmic functions (log, ln)
- Exponential calculations
- Square roots and powers
- Constants (π, e, etc.)
- Degree/radian conversion
- Factorial calculations

### Unit Conversion Features

The Unit Conversion mode supports conversions between:

- Length (meters, feet, inches, miles, etc.)
- Weight (kilograms, pounds, ounces, etc.)
- Volume (liters, gallons, cubic meters, etc.)
- Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
- Time (seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.)
- Area (square meters, acres, hectares, etc.)
- Speed (km/h, mph, m/s, etc.)
- Data storage (bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, etc.)

## How to Use

### Basic Calculations
