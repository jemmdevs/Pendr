## Understanding Password Strength

### What Makes a Strong Password?

A strong password typically:

- Is at least 12 characters long
- Contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Includes numbers and special characters
- Avoids personal information (names, birthdays, etc.)
- Doesn't use common words or phrases
- Is unique to each service or website

### Common Password Vulnerabilities

The tool checks for common weaknesses:

- **Dictionary Words**: Common words are easily guessed
- **Sequential Patterns**: Like "123456" or "qwerty"
- **Repeated Characters**: Such as "aaaaaa" or "111111"
- **Personal Information**: Names, birthdays, or other identifiable data
- **Known Breaches**: Passwords exposed in previous data breaches

## Best Practices for Password Security

### Creating Strong Passwords

- Use passphrases (multiple words combined with numbers and symbols)
- Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords
- Create a system for generating unique passwords for different sites
- Avoid writing passwords down physically or storing them unencrypted

### Maintaining Password Security

- Change passwords regularly, especially for critical accounts
- Use two-factor authentication when available
- Don't reuse passwords across different services
- Be cautious of phishing attempts asking for your password

## Beyond Password Strength

Remember that password strength is just one aspect of online security:

- Keep your devices and software updated
- Be cautious about the information you share online
- Use secure, encrypted connections (look for HTTPS)
- Regularly check for unauthorized access to your accounts

The Password Checker is designed to be an educational tool that helps you understand and improve your password habits, ultimately enhancing your overall digital security.
